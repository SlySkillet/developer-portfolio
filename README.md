Portfolio website to show to employers and clients

This will include all sample projects from The Odin Project and Jonas Schmedtmann curiculums. It is meant to show my skills in creating a website as well as the work I've done in independent learning. It will have my resume included. Links to GitHub, LinkedIn and maybe a Twitter as well. Eventually this should be a website with a translated option (English and Spanish).
